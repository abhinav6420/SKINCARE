                    <h3>Must-have skin care products</h3>
                    <p>Give your skin the love it deserves with high performance, top-rated skin care products. At Ulta Beauty, we offer an extensive lineup of products to meet you at every step of your skin care routine.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Cleansers</h4>
                    <p>Cleansers are an essential skin care product designed to remove impurities, dirt and makeup from the skin. Whether you’re a newbie or skin care obsessed, everyone should have these in their beauty stash:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Makeup remover, to easily melt away makeup from the surface of the skin.</li>
                        <li>Face wash, to cleanse away excess makeup and impurities from your pores.</li>
                        <li>Toner, to remove any traces of dirt and impurities stuck in your pores after washing your face.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Application tip: Use and apply the products mentioned above in the order of which they’re listed for best results. If you’re curious about what comes next, learn how to properly layer your skin care products.</p>

                    <h4>Treatments and serums</h4>
                    <p>Give your skin an extra boost or target specific concerns with treatments and serums. At Ulta Beauty, we offer a variety of serums, masks and treatments, including essentials like:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hyaluronic acid, to help increase the moisture content in your skin.</li>
                        <li>Vitamin C serum, to help brighten and even your skin tone.</li>
                        <li>Salicylic acid, to exfoliate the skin and treat breakouts.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>With any new serum, always spot treat before adding them into your skin care routine to avoid irritation.</p>

                    <h4>Moisturizers</h4>
                    <p>After applying your toners and serums, seal the skin and lock in moisture with a daily moisturizer. A quality moisturizer is a skin care product that should be in everyone’s routine, both day and night – think cream or gel-based moisturizers during the day and night creams before bed.</p>

                    <h4>Suncare</h4>
                    <p>Suncare is skin care! Protect yourself head-to-toe from the sun’s rays with these suncare must-haves:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sunscreen, to protect your face and body from sunburn.</li>
                        <li>Tanning oil and browning lotion, to accelerate the tanning process in your skin.</li>
                        <li>After sun lotion, to restore moisture, soothe the skin and reduce redness.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Pro-tip: Before you go applying sunscreen, it’s important to note that not all sunscreen is for the face; prevent clogged pores by carefully reading the packaging to ensure it’s intended for use on the face.</p>
                    <p>Looking for the sun-kissed look without the sun? Shop self-tanning and bronzing products to quickly get a beautiful glow.</p>

                    <h4>Skin supplements</h4>
                    <p>While the products we apply help improve the health and appearance of our skin, our lifestyle and diet play a significant role in the health of our skin. Protect your skin from the inside out with our wide variety of skin care supplements that include skin-boosting vitamins and antioxidants like collagen, biotin and vitamin C.</p>

                    <h4>Tools and devices</h4>
                    <p>Improve the appearance of your skin and get more benefits from your products with skin care tools and devices, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Red light therapy masks and wands, to even skin tone and ease irritation.</li>
                        <li>Gua shas, to increase circulation and sculpt the face.</li>
                        <li>Microcurrent facial toning devices, to tone, lift and contour areas of the face.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In addition to the unique skin care benefits that these tools and devices provide, they’re a unique way to elevate your self-care routine.</p>

                    <h4>How to choose skin care products that are right for you</h4>
                    <p>Skin care is personal and isn’t a one size fits all solution. Before choosing any products to add to your routine, it’s important to know your skin type, what concerns you want to address and a basic understanding of skin care ingredients.</p
